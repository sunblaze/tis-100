# Sunblaze's TIS-100 Segments

## Objective
In my first play through of the game I'm trying to complete each segment with the least amount of nodes. I figured it would be cool to share my approaches to acheving this. In later play throughs I'll try tackling lowering the instructions used and cycles taken.

```
Saves ending in 0.txt: Lowest number of nodes
Saves ending in 1.txt: Lowest instruction count
Saves ending in 2.txt: Lowest cycles
```
